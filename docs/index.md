This is the homepage of the entire description and all the specifications of EHMI. Some may be described here, while others will be linked to from here. For instance, all HL7 FHIR Specifications is to be found in their respective Implementation Guides (IG) following the standard for publishing by HL7. Other specifications may be shared with our partners in the Danish Health Data Authority and therefore have a format that suits them as well.

<br/> 

**For now, specifications published here at 01-04-2024 will focus on the Production pilot for EHMI and are therefore narrowed down to show only what is currently ready. By the end of Q2 2024 several more specifications and descriptions will be released on these sites and make the documentation more comprehensive.**
