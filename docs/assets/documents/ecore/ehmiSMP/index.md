# Service Metadata Publisher (SMP)

The eDelivery SMP profile is an open specification for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network. To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, an entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the recipient (Access Point) of the business document, such as types of documents the Access Point is capable of receiving and methods of transport supported. The recipient makes this metadata available to other entities in the network through a Service Metadata Publisher service. The eDelivery SMP profile describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover Access Point metadata. The profile is based on the OASIS Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) Version 1.0 standard.
